# Objective-Z

Objective-C transpiler for Zephyr RTOS.

Converts `.m` sources to plain C via Clang AST analysis — no ObjC runtime needed. Packaged as a Zephyr module with a Platform Abstraction Layer (PAL) for zero-cost Zephyr integration.

## Why Objective-Z?

Several languages promise better abstractions over C for embedded development. We evaluated each against the reality of building on Zephyr RTOS, where the entire ecosystem — kernel, drivers, build system, macros — is C.

- **[Rust](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr-lang-rust)** — Amazing language, but adopting it means emigrating, not just learning new syntax. The borrow checker rewires how developers think about lifetimes — far from the C mindset. The toolchain is a separate compiler from Zephyr's, creating two-ABI friction. Every kernel API needs FFI bindings that break on upstream updates. Kernel-level development is effectively off-limits. Binaries are harder to audit for WCET.

- **[C++](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/languages/cpp/index.html)** — Looks C-compatible but isn't. Zephyr's macro-heavy API (`K_THREAD_DEFINE`, `K_SEM_DEFINE`, `DEVICE_DT_DEFINE`) relies on C-specific preprocessor behavior; compiling with `g++` changes the language under the macros. Beyond that, C++ has grown so aggressively that it's fractured into eras — a developer comfortable with C++03 faces a nearly foreign language in C++20/23. It keeps trying to become something else, which is bad for teams rooted in C.

- **[Zig](https://github.com/nodecum/zig-zephyr)** — The most sympathetic "better C": no hidden control flow, `comptime` instead of macros, good C interop. But it shares Rust's separate-compiler problem and deliberately does not support OOP — no classes, no inheritance, no method dispatch. Approximating interfaces requires acrobatics the language doesn't enforce. A genuine step over C, but it lacks the abstraction vocabulary Objective-Z provides.

- **[Nim](https://github.com/EmbeddedNim/nephyr)** — The closest competitor: it also transpiles to C, has `--mm:arc` for deterministic memory management, and an `EmbeddedNim` community with a Zephyr wrapper (`nephyr`). However, despite transpiling to C, Nim is a completely different language — Python-inspired syntax, significant whitespace, its own module system and metaprogramming model. The learning curve for a C team is substantial; it's not incremental. Zephyr's C macros (`K_THREAD_DEFINE`, `DEVICE_DT_DEFINE`, etc.) don't pass through Nim's FFI cleanly — bindings must manually replicate what the macros expand to, creating a fragile maintenance burden on every Zephyr update. Nim's OOP model uses garbage-collected reference types by default, the generated C is Nim-idiomatic rather than human-auditable, and the embedded ecosystem remains small.

- **[Swift](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-embedded-examples)** — The obvious question given Objective-C heritage. Embedded Swift (announced WWDC 2024) strips runtime reflection and existentials to target microcontrollers, and has experimental Zephyr integration. But it's still a separate LLVM-based compiler with its own ABI, the embedded subset is experimental, and it disables the very features (protocols as existentials, ARC with full runtime) that make Swift feel like Swift. You get a hobbled Swift instead of full Objective-C lowered to clean C.

- **[Ada/SPARK](https://github.com/zephyr-ada/ada-project-example)** — The establishment answer for safety-critical embedded, with proven formal verification. Deserves respect. But there is no official Zephyr support — only a proof-of-concept requiring a custom SDK rebuild with GNAT enabled. The language, toolchain, and ecosystem are unfamiliar to teams coming from C. Adoption cost is enormous for what amounts to a parallel universe.

- **[Lua](https://github.com/rodrigopex/lua_zephyr)** — Tiny interpreter, easy to embed in C, widely used for scripting in games and IoT gateways. But it's interpreted — every instruction pays a runtime dispatch cost that destroys WCET analyzability. The VM requires heap allocation for tables, strings, and closures. You can strip it down (eLua, Lua-RTOS), but you're still paying for an interpreter loop where you need deterministic, compiled code. It adds a scripting layer on top of C rather than improving how you write the C itself.

- **[Go/TinyGo](https://tinygo.org)** — The garbage collector is a one-line disqualifier for zero-heap, deterministic, ISR-safe embedded systems.

### The Objective-Z answer

These alternatives fail for different reasons — a separate compiler (Rust, Zig, Swift, Ada), broken macro compatibility (all of them, even C++ and Nim), an unfamiliar language model (Rust, Nim, Ada), a hobbled feature subset (Swift), an interpreter with heap allocation (Lua), or a garbage collector (Go) — but they share one root cause: they ask the embedded C team to leave C.

Objective-Z doesn't. The developer writes Objective-C — a strict superset of C — and the entire Zephyr API surface (macros, kernel calls, devicetree accessors, everything) is directly visible and usable in the Objective-C source with zero bindings. The transpiler then converts it to plain, auditable C. The compiler only ever sees C. The linker only ever sees C. No new compiler. No FFI bindings. No interpreter. No garbage collector. No moving target. No unfamiliar syntax. The team gains classes, protocols, ARC-based RAII, and deterministic dispatch without leaving the world they already understand. And because the transpiler output is plain C with static dispatch, it performs at similar speed to C++ — without the macro incompatibilities, the fractured standard, or the compiler change.

## Design

### Static-first design

Existing Objective-C runtimes — Apple libobjc, GNUstep libobjc2, ObjFW, mulle-objc — assume a general-purpose heap. All dispatch tables, class tables, selector tables, and object instances are `malloc`'d at runtime. This is fine for desktop/mobile but incompatible with deterministic embedded firmware on MCUs with 64-512 KB RAM and no MMU.

Objective-Z inverts this: the transpiler converts `.m` files to plain C at build time via Clang JSON AST analysis. Dispatch tables are `const` vtable arrays in `.rodata` (FLASH), indexed by `class_id` — zero RAM overhead. When the receiver type is known at transpile time, protocol calls are resolved to direct function calls via compile-time dispatch (`OZ_SEND` macro with token concatenation). Object instances are served from per-class `k_mem_slab` pools (BSS), auto-generated from AST analysis. No heap allocation needed.

### No dynamic ObjC magic

Features that require unbounded runtime allocation — KVO, method swizzling, dynamic class creation, associated objects, weak references, message forwarding — are removed. Only the core language features that can be fully resolved at build time remain: classes, protocols, categories, properties, blocks, ARC.

### Zephyr-native

Built on Zephyr primitives (`k_mem_slab`, `SYS_INIT`, `k_spinlock_t`, `atomic_t`), not POSIX. No libc `malloc` dependency.

## Features

### Dispatch

- **Static dispatch** — direct C function calls for non-protocol methods (5-9 cycles)
- **Compile-time dispatch** — protocol calls resolved to direct calls when receiver type is known at transpile time (5-9 cycles)
- **Protocol vtable dispatch** — `const` vtable arrays in `.rodata` (zero RAM), 19 cycles polymorphic fallback for `id`-typed receivers
- **Class methods** — static function calls

### Memory Management

- **Compile-time ARC** — scope-based retain/release, auto-dealloc, break/continue cleanup
- **Per-class slab pools** — auto-generated from AST analysis, zero heap overhead
- **`@autoreleasepool`** — scoped memory management
- **Foundation classes** — `OZString`, `OZArray`, `OZDictionary`, `OZNumber` with fast enumeration

### Language Features

- **Categories** — merged at AST collection time
- **`@property` / `@synthesize`** — atomic and strong semantics
- **`@synchronized`** — RAII spinlock via OZSpinLock
- **Blocks** — non-capturing blocks transpiled to static C functions
- **`__block` variables** — promoted to file-scope static
- **Fast enumeration** — `for (id obj in collection)` via IteratorProtocol
- **Boxed literals** — `@42`, `@3.14f`, `@YES`
- **Collection literals** — `@[a, b, c]`, `@{key: value}`
- **Subscript syntax** — `array[0]`, `dict[@"key"]`
- **Lightweight generics** — typed collections
- **`+initialize`** — auto-called before `main()` via `SYS_INIT` (singleton pattern)

### Tooling

- **Three-pass transpiler** — Clang JSON AST -> collect -> resolve -> emit -> pure C
- **Platform Abstraction Layer** — zero-cost `static inline` with Zephyr and host backends
- **clangd IDE support** — auto-generated `compile_commands.json`

## How It Compares

All benchmarks on **nRF52833 DK** (ARM Cortex-M4F @ 64 MHz), DWT cycle counter. OZ benchmark is pure Objective-C transpiled to C. Single inheritance only (ObjC limitation).

## Quick Start

```sh
# Clone and enter
git clone https://github.com/peixotooo/objective-z.git
cd objective-z

# Build the hello_world sample

```

## Samples

12 samples under `samples/`, each demonstrating different transpiler features:

| Sample                 | Description                                        |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `hello_world`          | Basic class and instance method dispatch            |
| `hello_category`       | Category extensions (adding methods to classes)     |
| `arc_demo`             | ARC lifecycle, scoped cleanup, singletons, threads  |
| `mem_demo`             | ARC memory management, autorelease pools            |

| `gpio_demo`            | GPIO input/output with Zephyr devicetree            |
| `zbus_objc`            | Zephyr zbus pub/sub messaging                       |
| `zbus_service`         | Request-response service pattern                    |

Build a specific sample:

```sh
just project_dir=samples/arc_demo rebuild
just run
```

### hello_world

```objc
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

@interface MyFirstObject: OZObject
- (void)greet;
+ (void)greet;
@end

@implementation MyFirstObject

- (void)greet
{
    OZLog("Hello, world from object");
}

+ (void)greet
{
    OZLog("Hello, world from class");
}

@end

int main(void)
{
    [MyFirstObject greet];

    MyFirstObject *hello = [[MyFirstObject alloc] init];
    [hello greet];

    return 0;
}
```

The transpiler converts this to plain C: `MyFirstObject_greet(self)` for instance methods, `MyFirstObject_class_greet()` for class methods, and `OZObject_slab_alloc()`/`OZObject_init()` for object creation. The generated code compiles with GCC — no ObjC compiler or runtime needed at build time.

## Architecture

```
.m sources -> Clang JSON AST -> oz_transpile (Python) -> .h + .c -> GCC -> binary
```

### Transpiler Pipeline

Three-pass architecture in `tools/oz_transpile/`:

1. **Collect** (`collect.py`) — Walks Clang JSON AST nodes, builds `OZModule` with classes, methods, ivars, protocols, categories
2. **Resolve** (`resolve.py`) — Validates hierarchy, assigns topological class IDs, computes `base_depth`, classifies dispatch (STATIC vs PROTOCOL)
3. **Emit** (`emit.py`) — Generates per-class `.h`/`.c` files + `oz_dispatch.h`/`.c` (`const` vtable arrays, compile-time dispatch macros, slab definitions)

### Platform Abstraction Layer

Zero-cost `static inline` abstraction in `include/platform/`:

| Header                  | Purpose                                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `oz_platform.h`         | `#ifdef` router (Zephyr vs Host)               |
| `oz_platform_zephyr.h`  | `k_mem_slab`, Zephyr atomics, `k_spinlock_t`, `printk` |
| `oz_platform_host.h`    | malloc-backed slab, C11 `stdatomic`, `printf`  |
| `oz_platform_types.h`   | Shared type definitions                        |
| `oz_lock.h`             | OZSpinLock RAII spinlock for `@synchronized`    |
| `oz_assert.h`           | Assertion macros                               |

All PAL functions vanish at `-O1+` — zero runtime overhead.

### Generated Code

For each class, the transpiler emits:

- **`ClassName.h`** — struct definition, method prototypes, vtable extern
- **`ClassName.c`** — method implementations, vtable array, slab pool definition
- **`oz_dispatch.h`** — class ID enum, `OZ_IMPL_*` compile-time dispatch macros, `OZ_SEND()` generic macro, `OZ_PROTOCOL_SEND_*` polymorphic fallback macros
- **`oz_dispatch.c`** — `const` vtable arrays (`OZ_PROTOCOL_RESOLVE_*`) in `.rodata`, class introspection tables

## Using in Your Project

### 1. Add Objective-Z to your west manifest

In your application's `west.yml`, add objective-z as a project:

```yaml
manifest:
  remotes:
    - name: zephyrproject-rtos
      url-base: https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos

  projects:
    - name: zephyr
      remote: zephyrproject-rtos
      revision: main
      import:
        name-allowlist:
          - cmsis

    - name: objective-z
      url: https://github.com/rodrigopex/objective-z/
      revision: main
      path: objective-z

  self:
    path: my_app
```

Then run `west update` to fetch the module.

### 2. Directory layout

```
my_app/
├── west.yml
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── prj.conf
└── src/
    └── main.m
```

### 3. CMakeLists.txt

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20.0)

find_package(Zephyr REQUIRED HINTS $ENV{ZEPHYR_BASE})
project(my_app)

# Transpile .m sources to C (ARC always enabled)
objz_transpile_sources(app src/main.m)
```

### 4. prj.conf

```ini
CONFIG_OBJZ=y
```

The transpiler automatically includes Foundation classes (OZObject, OZString, OZArray, OZDictionary, OZNumber) and generates slab pools for all classes found in the AST.

### 5. Write your .m file

```objc
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

@interface Sensor: OZObject {
    int _value;
}
- (void)setValue:(int)v;
- (int)value;
@end

@implementation Sensor
- (void)setValue:(int)v { _value = v; }
- (int)value { return _value; }

- (void)dealloc
{
    OZLog("Sensor dealloc (value=%d)", _value);
}
@end

int main(void)
{
    Sensor *s = [[Sensor alloc] init];
    [s setValue:42];
    OZLog("value=%d", [s value]);
    /* ARC releases s here -> dealloc fires */
    return 0;
}
```

### 6. Build

```sh
west build -p -b mps2/an385 .
```

### CMake API

```
objz_transpile_sources(<target> <source1.m> [source2.m ...]
    [ROOT_CLASS <name>]
    [POOL_SIZES <Class1=N,Class2=M,...>]
    [INCLUDE_DIRS <dir1> [dir2 ...]]
)
```

| Parameter      | Default    | Description                              |
| -------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `ROOT_CLASS`   | `OZObject` | Root class name for hierarchy resolution |
| `POOL_SIZES`   | auto       | Override slab pool sizes per class       |
| `INCLUDE_DIRS` | --         | Additional include directories for AST   |

## Prerequisites

- Zephyr SDK + west (see [Zephyr Getting Started](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html))
- Clang 20+ (for AST analysis — Apple Clang works for ARM, Homebrew LLVM for RISC-V; older versions may crash on ObjC JSON AST dump)
- Python 3
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) (build automation)

## Configuration

`CONFIG_OBJZ` is the only Kconfig option. It enables the transpiler pipeline and auto-selects `STATIC_INIT_GNU`.

Supported architectures:

- ARM Cortex-M
- ARM Cortex-A
- RISC-V 32/64-bit (requires LLVM Clang, not Apple Clang)

```

## Limitations

See [docs/LIMITATIONS.md](docs/LIMITATIONS.md) for the full list. Key limitations:

- **Non-capturing blocks only** — blocks that capture local variables produce a diagnostic error
- **No `typedef`** — use explicit types
- **No `@try`/`@catch`/`@throw`** — exception handling not supported
- **No dynamic dispatch** for non-protocol methods — all resolved statically
- **OZNumber**: 8/16/32-bit integers and float only (no int64/double)

<summary><strong>ARC Guide</strong></summary>

## ARC Guide

Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) is always enabled. The transpiler inserts `retain`/`release` calls at compile time — you never call them manually.

### How it works

```objc
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

@interface Sensor: OZObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) id delegate;
- (void)measure;
@end

@implementation Sensor
@synthesize delegate = _delegate;

- (void)measure
{
    OZLog("Measuring...");
}

- (void)dealloc
{
    OZLog("Sensor deallocated");
    /* ARC auto-inserts [super dealloc] — do NOT call it yourself */
}
@end

void demo(void)
{
    Sensor *s = [[Sensor alloc] init]; /* rc=1 */
    [s measure];
    /* ARC releases s here — dealloc fires automatically */
}
```

### Strong properties and `.cxx_destruct`

When a class has `strong` properties (or ivars), ARC generates a hidden `.cxx_destruct` method that releases them before `-dealloc` runs:

```objc
@interface Driver: OZObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) Sensor *sensor;
@end

@implementation Driver
@synthesize sensor = _sensor;

- (void)dealloc
{
    OZLog("Driver deallocated");
    /* .cxx_destruct already released _sensor before we get here */
}
@end

void demo(void)
{
    Driver *d = [[Driver alloc] init];
    d.sensor = [[Sensor alloc] init];
    /* ARC releases d -> .cxx_destruct releases sensor -> both dealloc */
}
```

### `@autoreleasepool`

Critical in loops that create temporary objects — without it, temporaries accumulate until the enclosing scope ends:

```objc
/* BAD: all 1000 temporaries live until function returns */
void process_bad(void)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        id tmp = [SomeFactory create];
    }
    /* all 1000 objects released here — peak memory is huge */
}

/* GOOD: each iteration drains its pool */
void process_good(void)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        @autoreleasepool {
            id tmp = [SomeFactory create];
            /* tmp released at end of @autoreleasepool block */
        }
    }
    /* peak memory: only 1 object at a time */
}
```

Use `@autoreleasepool` when:

- **Loops** create temporary objects
- **Worker threads** — each thread needs its own pool
- **Batch processing** — any code path that allocates many short-lived objects

### Retain cycles

ARC has no weak references (`__weak` panics at runtime). If two objects hold `strong` references to each other, neither can be deallocated:

```objc
/* PROBLEM: direct cycle — Parent <-> Child */
@interface Parent: OZObject
@property (nonatomic) Child *child;   /* strong by default */
@end

@interface Child: OZObject
@property (nonatomic) Parent *parent; /* strong — creates cycle! */
@end
```

#### Fix: use `__unsafe_unretained`

```objc
@interface Child: OZObject
@property (nonatomic, unsafe_unretained) Parent *parent; /* non-owning */
@end
```

> **Caution:** `__unsafe_unretained` pointers are not zeroed on dealloc. Ensure the owner outlives the child, or set the back-reference to `nil` before the owner is released.

#### Alternative: break the cycle manually

```objc
void no_leak(void)
{
    Node *a = [[Node alloc] init];
    Node *b = [[Node alloc] init];
    a.next = b;
    b.next = a;

    b.next = nil; /* break cycle before scope exit */
    /* ARC releases a -> releases b -> both dealloc */
}
```

### ARC rules summary

| Do                                      | Don't                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Use `objz_transpile_sources()` in CMake | Call `retain`, `release`, or `autorelease`      |
| Let the compiler manage object lifetime | Call `[super dealloc]` — ARC inserts it         |
| Use `@autoreleasepool` in loops/threads | Create strong reference cycles                  |
| Use `strong` properties for ownership   | Assume temporaries are released immediately     |
| Break cycles manually before scope exit | Use `__weak` (not supported, panics at runtime) |

## Benchmark (OZ-070)

Comprehensive OZ vs C++ benchmarks on **nRF52833 DK** (ARM Cortex-M4F @ 64 MHz), DWT cycle counter, overhead-calibrated. OZ benchmark is pure Objective-C transpiled to C. Single inheritance only (ObjC limitation).

```sh
just board=nrf52833dk/nrf52833 bench       # OZ speed benchmark (6 sections)
just board=nrf52833dk/nrf52833 bench-cpp   # C++ speed benchmark (7 sections)
just board=nrf52833dk/nrf52833 bench-mem   # Memory comparison (C, C++, OZ)
just test-bench                            # Run all via twister (hardware map)
just bench-footprint                       # ELF section size analysis

### Object Sizes

| Object                           | OZ (B) | C++ (B) |
| -------------------------------- | -----: | ------: |
| Base (metadata + refcount)       |      8 |       8 |
| Child (+ 1 int ivar)            |     12 |      12 |

### Firmware Footprint

| App         | text (B) | data (B) | bss (B) | total (B) |
| ----------- | -------: | -------: | ------: | --------: |
| OZ speed    |   27,184 |      568 |   8,445 |    36,197 |
| C++ speed   |   28,500 |      264 |  19,919 |    48,683 |
| OZ memory   |   21,348 |      180 |   7,344 |    28,872 |
| C++ memory  |   22,840 |      180 |  19,654 |    42,674 |

### Key Takeaways

- **Vtable dispatch is equivalent** — OZ const-array dispatch (20-21 cycles) matches C++ virtual dispatch (19-20 cycles)
- **OZ uses 2.5x less RAM** — slab pools in .bss (8.4 KB) vs C++ heap + STL (19.9 KB)
- **OZ heap alloc is 15% faster** than C++ new/delete (1,037 vs 1,217 cycles)
- **C++ placement-new from slab is 3.2x faster** than OZ slab (126 vs 400 cycles) — OZ overhead comes from init + ARC release
- **@synchronized is expensive** (398 cycles) due to OZSpinLock RAII alloc+free — k_spinlock alone is 15 cycles
- **Block invocation matches lambda** — both compile to function pointers (12 cycles)
- **OZ for-in iteration is 7x slower** than C++ range-for — iterator protocol overhead
- **OZ total firmware is 26% smaller** than C++ (36 KB vs 49 KB)

<summary>Legacy Runtime Reference</summary>

The following data is from the retired legacy ObjC runtime (`objc_msgSend`, heap allocation, ARC runtime). These benchmarks no longer build — the legacy runtime compilation path has been retired in favor of the transpiler.

</details>

### C++ Comparison

Side-by-side C++ vs Objective-Z on **nRF52833 DK** (ARM Cortex-M4F @ 64 MHz). All values in cycles.

#### Dispatch

| Operation                          | C++ | ObjC (transpiler) |
| ---------------------------------- | --: | ----------------: |
| C function pointer (baseline)      |   8 |                 8 |
| Direct / static / class method     |   2 |               5-9 |
| Compile-time protocol dispatch     |  -- |               5-9 |
| Virtual / const vtable (depth=0)   |  20 |                19 |
| Virtual / const vtable (depth=1)   |  21 |                19 |
| Virtual / const vtable (depth=2)   |  20 |                19 |

> With compile-time dispatch, most protocol calls resolve to direct function calls (5-9 cycles) — same cost as static dispatch. Const vtable dispatch (19 cycles, depth-independent) matches C++ virtual calls (20-21 cycles) and is only used for truly polymorphic `id`-typed receivers. Vtable arrays are `const` in `.rodata` — zero RAM overhead.

#### Object Lifecycle

| Operation                              |   C++ | ObjC (transpiler) |
| -------------------------------------- | ----: | ----------------: |
| Slab / heap alloc+dealloc              |   995 |               228 |
| Placement new + dtor + slab free       |   130 |                -- |
| `unique_ptr` create/destroy            | 1,072 |                -- |

> Transpiler slab alloc+init+release (228 cycles) is **4.4x faster** than C++ `new`/`delete` (995 cycles). Both C++ placement new (130 cycles) and ObjC slab (228 cycles) use `k_mem_slab` — the extra ObjC cycles cover `init` vtable call + ARC release.

#### Reference Counting

| Operation                     |   C++ | ObjC (transpiler) |
| ----------------------------- | ----: | ----------------: |
| Atomic increment              |    14 |                17 |
| Atomic inc + dec pair         |    24 |                44 |
| `shared_ptr` copy             | 1,140 |                -- |
| `shared_ptr` copy + reset     | 1,182 |                -- |

> `OZObject_retain` (17 cycles) is close to raw `atomic_fetch_add` (14 cycles) — 3 cycles for null check. C++ `shared_ptr` operations (1,140+ cycles) are 67x slower due to control block allocation and atomic operations on the control block.

#### Introspection (C++)

| Operation          | Cycles |
| ------------------ | -----: |
| `dynamic_cast` (hit)  |      2 |
| `dynamic_cast` (miss) |      2 |
| `typeid()`             |      4 |

#### Lambdas / std::function (C++)

| Operation                          | Cycles |
| ---------------------------------- | -----: |
| C function pointer call            |      8 |
| Non-capturing lambda (func ptr)    |      9 |
| `std::function` invocation         |     25 |
| `std::function` copy + destroy     |    102 |

### Memory Comparison

Per-object memory cost across C, C++, and Objective-Z on **nRF52833 DK**. C/C++ use a dedicated 8 KB `sys_heap`. ObjC uses per-class `k_mem_slab` pools (zero allocator overhead).

#### Object Sizes

| Metric                     |    C |  C++ | ObjC (transpiler) |
| -------------------------- | ---: | ---: | ----------------: |
| Base object (sizeof)       |  8 B |  8 B |               8 B |
| Child (+ 1 int)            | 12 B | 12 B |              12 B |
| GrandChild (+ 2 ints)      | 16 B | 16 B |              16 B |
| Dispatch mechanism         |  4 B |  4 B |       4 B (enum)  |
| Refcount field             |  4 B |  4 B |               4 B |

> Object sizes are identical — all embed a 4 B dispatch field + 4 B refcount. The transpiler uses `enum oz_class_id` as vtable index instead of a vptr.

#### Single Allocation

| Object type   |     C |   C++ | ObjC (transpiler) |
| ------------- | ----: | ----: | ----------------: |
| Base          | 16 B  | 16 B  |               8 B |
| Child         | 16 B  | 16 B  |              12 B |
| GrandChild    | 24 B  | 24 B  |              16 B |

> Transpiler slab allocation has **zero overhead** — block size equals `sizeof(struct)`. C/C++ `sys_heap` adds 4-8 B per allocation (chunk header).

#### Bulk Allocation (20 objects)

| Object type        |      C |    C++ | ObjC (transpiler) |
| ------------------ | -----: | -----: | ----------------: |
| 20x Child          | 320 B  | 320 B  |             240 B |
| 20x GrandChild     | 480 B  | 480 B  |             320 B |
| Per GrandChild avg |  24 B  |  24 B  |              16 B |

> 33% less memory per object with slab allocation (16 B vs 24 B) — zero heap metadata overhead.

#### Smart Pointers / Reference Counting (C++)

| Metric                          |               C++ |          ObjC |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------: | ------------: |
| `sizeof(unique_ptr)`            |               4 B |             - |
| `sizeof(shared_ptr)`            |               8 B |             - |
| `make_unique` heap cost         |              16 B |             - |
| `make_shared` heap cost         |    24 B (+ ctrl)  |             - |
| `shared_ptr(new T)` heap cost   | 40 B (2 allocs)   |             - |
| Manual `atomic<int>` refcount   |     4 B (inline)  |  4 B (inline) |

> ObjC stores the refcount inline (0 extra heap cost). C++ `make_shared` adds a ~16 B control block; `shared_ptr(new T)` does two allocations totaling 40 B.
